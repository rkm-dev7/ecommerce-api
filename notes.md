1. what is "query" and "params" in express?
---

--->In Express.js, both query and params are ways to extract data from a URL, but they serve slightly different purposes and are used in different parts of the URL.

1. Query Parameters:
   Location: Query parameters are located in the URL after a question mark ? and are separated by ampersands &. For example, in the URL /search?query=express&limit=10, query and limit are query parameters.

Usage: Query parameters are typically used to provide optional data to a route or endpoint. They are commonly used for filtering, sorting, or specifying options in a request. Here are some common use cases for query parameters with examples:

    Filtering Data:
    You can use query parameters to filter data based on specific criteria. For example, in an API for a list of products, you can use query parameters to filter products by category or price range.
    Example:
        /products?category=electronics filters products in the "electronics" category.
        /products?minPrice=50&maxPrice=100 filters products with prices between $50 and $100.

    Pagination:
    Query parameters are often used for implementing pagination by specifying the page number and the number of items per page.
    Example:
        /articles?page=2&perPage=10 requests the second page of articles with 10 articles per page.

    Sorting:
    You can use query parameters to specify the sorting order for a list of items.
    Example:
        /students?sort=lastName sorts students by their last names in ascending order.
        /books?sort=price&order=desc sorts books by price in descending order.

    Search and Filtering:
    Query parameters are useful for search functionality, allowing users to search for specific content.
    Example:
        /search?query=express searches for content containing the word "express."

    API Versioning:
    In API development, query parameters can be used to specify the version of the API to use.
    Example:
        /api/v1/users accesses version 1 of the API for user-related endpoints.
        /api/v2/users accesses version 2 of the API for user-related endpoints.

    Customization and Options:
    Query parameters can be used to customize or provide options for a request, such as specifying a language or format.
    Example:
        /news?lang=en fetches news articles in English.
        /export?format=pdf exports a document in PDF format.

2. Route Parameters (Params):
   Location: Route parameters are part of the route path itself and are defined by adding a colon : before a parameter name. For example, in the route path /users/:userId, :userId is a route parameter.

Usage: Route parameters are used to capture specific parts of the URL that are essential to the route. They are often used to identify and retrieve specific resources.

Access: In Express.js, you can access route parameters using the req.params object.

Example:
app.get('/users/:userId', (req, res) => {
const userId = req.params.userId; // Access the 'userId' route parameter
// Use the userId value in your logic
});

2. what is headers?

---

HTTP headers are essential components of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used in web communication. Headers are metadata associated with an HTTP request or response, providing information about the data being transferred, the server, and the client. They play a crucial role in controlling and shaping the behavior of web interactions. Here are some common types of HTTP headers and their purposes:

    Request Headers:
        User-Agent: Provides information about the user's browser or client application.
        Host: Specifies the domain name of the server (e.g., www.example.com).
        Authorization: Contains credentials for authentication (e.g., JWT tokens, basic authentication).
        Accept: Indicates the types of media (e.g., JSON, XML) the client can accept in the response.
        Content-Type: Specifies the media type of the request payload (e.g., application/json).
        Cookie: Contains data saved in the client's browser, often used for session management.

    Response Headers:
        Content-Type: Defines the media type of the response body (e.g., text/html, application/json).
        Content-Length: Indicates the size of the response body in bytes.
        Cache-Control: Controls caching behavior (e.g., "no-cache," "public").
        Location: Used in redirections to specify the new URL to which the client should navigate.
        Set-Cookie: Informs the client to set a cookie for future requests.
        Server: Identifies the software or server stack running on the server.

    General Headers:
        Date: Indicates the date and time when the response was generated.
        Connection: Controls whether the connection should be kept alive or closed after the request/response cycle.
        Pragma: Used for backward compatibility and caching control.
        Upgrade: Specifies additional communication protocols that the client and server can switch to.

HTTP headers enable communication between the client (typically a web browser or application) and the server. They facilitate features like content negotiation (choosing the right response format), authentication, caching, and redirection. Developers can manipulate and add custom headers as needed to tailor the behavior of web requests and responses.

Headers are often accessed and set programmatically in web applications, whether in server-side code (e.g., Express.js middleware) or client-side JavaScript, to control various aspects of the HTTP communication.

3. what is "new RegExp()"?

---

The primary purpose of new RegExp() is to create a regular expression object. Regular expressions are used for pattern matching within strings. They are a powerful tool for searching, extracting, and manipulating text based on patterns.

Example:

    const regex = new RegExp(pattern, flags);

    pattern (string): This is the core of the regular expression and represents the pattern you want to match in strings. It can contain various characters and special symbols that define the pattern. For example, /hello/ is a regular expression pattern that matches the word "hello" in a string.

    flags (optional string): Flags modify the behavior of the regular expression. They are specified as a string containing one or more characters. Common flags include:
        g (global flag): Matches all occurrences of the pattern, not just the first one.
        i (case-insensitive flag): Matches characters regardless of case.
        m (multiline flag): Treats a string as multiple lines, affecting the behavior of ^ and $ in the pattern.

Using new RegExp() for Dynamic Patterns:

One significant advantage of new RegExp() is that it allows you to create regular expressions with dynamic patterns. You can construct the pattern as a string, and the constructor allows you to interpolate variables or user input into the pattern.

const searchTerm = "John";
const regex = new RegExp(`.*${searchTerm}.*`, "i");

In this example, searchTerm is a variable that can be dynamically inserted into the regular expression pattern, enabling flexible and dynamic pattern matching.

Working with Flags:

The second argument to new RegExp() is optional but allows you to specify flags that modify the behavior of the regular expression. Flags control aspects such as case-sensitivity and whether the regular expression should match globally.

const regex = new RegExp("pattern", "gi");

In this example, the regular expression regex is created with both the global (g) and case-insensitive (i) flags.

Testing and Matching Strings:

Once you have a regular expression object, you can use methods like test(), exec(), and match() to work with strings.

    test(string): The test() method checks whether a given string matches a regular expression pattern. It returns true if a match is found and false if no match is found.

    exec(string): The exec() method is used to search for a match in a string and returns an array containing details about the first match found. If no match is found, it returns null.

    match(regex):The match() method is used to find one or more matches of a regular expression pattern within a string. It returns an array of matching substrings or null if no matches are found.

    replace(regex, replacement_String): The replace() method is used to replace matched substrings in a string with a specified replacement string. It takes a regular expression pattern and a replacement string as arguments.

Examples:

    const text = "Hello, world!";
    const regex = /Hello/;

    const isMatch = regex.test(text);
    const matchDetails = regex.exec(text);
    const allMatches = text.match(regex);
    const newText = text.replace(regex, "Hi");

Advanced Patterns:

Regular expressions support a wide range of advanced patterns and techniques, including character classes, quantifiers, capturing groups, and more. These patterns can be used to match complex text patterns.

For example, the regular expression /[0-9]{2,4}/ matches sequences of 2 to 4 digits in a string.

4. MongoDB query operators

---

Equality Operators: $eq, $ne

    $eq: Matches documents where the specified field is equal to a specified value.
    $ne: Matches documents where the specified field is not equal to a specified value.

    // Find users with age equal to 30
    db.users.find({ age: { $eq: 30 } });

    // Find users with name not equal to "John Doe"
    db.users.find({ name: { $ne: "John Doe" } });

Comparison Operators: $lt, $lte, $gt, $gte

    $lt: Matches documents where the specified field is less than a specified value.
    $lte: Matches documents where the specified field is less than or equal to a specified value.
    $gt: Matches documents where the specified field is greater than a specified value.
    $gte: Matches documents where the specified field is greater than or equal to a specified value.

    // Find users younger than 25
    db.users.find({ age: { $lt: 25 } });

    // Find users aged 25 or older
    db.users.find({ age: { $gte: 25 } });

Logical Operators: $and, $or, $not

    $and: Joins query clauses with a logical AND and returns documents that match all the conditions.
    $or: Joins query clauses with a logical OR and returns documents that match at least one of the conditions.
    $not: Inverts the effect of a query expression and returns documents that do not match the query.

    // Find users with age greater than 25 and whose name is not "Alice Smith"
    db.users.find({ $and: [{ age: { $gt: 25 } }, { name: { $ne: "Alice Smith" } }] });

    // Find users aged 30 or users named "John Doe"
    db.users.find({ $or: [{ age: 30 }, { name: "John Doe" }] });

    // Find users who are not aged 35
    db.users.find({ age: { $not: { $eq: 35 } } });

Array Operators: $in, $nin, $elemMatch, $size

    $in: Matches documents where the specified field's value is in an array of specified values.
    $nin: Matches documents where the specified field's value is not in an array of specified values.
    $elemMatch: Matches documents that contain an array with at least one element that matches all the specified query criteria.
    $size: Matches documents where the specified array field has a specific number of elements.

    // Find users whose age is either 25 or 35
    db.users.find({ age: { $in: [25, 35] } });

    // Find users whose age is neither 25 nor 35
    db.users.find({ age: { $nin: [25, 35] } });

    // Find users with at least one skill "MongoDB" and "JavaScript"
    db.users.find({ skills: { $elemMatch: { $in: ["MongoDB", "JavaScript"] } } });

    // Find users with exactly 3 skills
    db.users.find({ skills: { $size: 3 } });

Pattern Matching: $regex

    Suppose you have a collection of products and want to find all products with names containing the word "phone" anywhere in the name.

        // Find products with names containing "phone"
        db.products.find({ name: { $regex: /phone/ } });

    In this example, we use the $regex operator to perform a case-sensitive search for the pattern /phone/ within the name field. It will return all products with names containing the word "phone."

Text Operators: $text

    The $text operator is used for text search on text-indexed fields. You need to create a text index on the field you want to search. Here's an example:

    // Create a text index on the "description" field
    db.products.createIndex({ description: "text" });

    // Search for products containing the word "computer" or "laptop"
    db.products.find({ $text: { $search: "computer laptop" } });

Geospatial Operators: $near, $geoWithin, $geoIntersects

    Geospatial operators are used for querying geospatial data. You'll need geospatial data in your collection and create appropriate indexes for these operators. Here's a simple example:

    // Create a 2D sphere index on the "location" field
    db.places.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere" });

    // Find places near a specific location within 10 kilometers
    db.places.find({
    location: {
        $nearSphere: {
        $geometry: {
            type: "Point",
            coordinates: [-73.97, 40.77] // Longitude and latitude
        },
        $maxDistance: 10000 // Maximum distance in meters (10 kilometers)
        }
    }
    });

    These examples demonstrate how to use MongoDB query operators for various purposes, from basic equality checks to advanced geospatial queries. Remember to tailor the queries to your specific data and use case.

5. projection in MongoDB.

---

Projection in MongoDB allows you to control which fields are included or excluded in the query results. This can be useful for optimizing query performance, reducing network traffic, and protecting sensitive data. Let's dive into the basics of projection in MongoDB:

Including Fields (Inclusion Projection):

    To include specific fields in the query results, you use the projection with a value of 1 for each field you want to include. Here's an example:

    // Include only the "name" and "email" fields in the query results
    db.users.find({}, { name: 1, email: 1 });

    In this example, only the "name" and "email" fields are included in the query results, while all other fields are excluded.

Excluding Fields (Exclusion Projection):

To exclude specific fields from the query results, you use the projection with a value of 0 for each field you want to exclude. Here's an example:

    // Exclude the "password" field from the query results
    db.users.find({}, { password: 0 });

    In this example, all fields are included in the query results except for the "password" field, which is excluded.

Including or Excluding the \_id Field:

By default, MongoDB includes the \_id field in query results. You can explicitly include or exclude it using projection:

    // Include the "_id" field in the query results
    db.collectionName.find({}, { _id: 1 });

    // Exclude the "_id" field from the query results
    db.collectionName.find({}, { _id: 0 });

Nested Fields and Array Elements:

Projection works with nested fields and array elements as well. For example, if you have a document structure like this:

    {
    "name": "John",
    "address": {
        "city": "New York",
        "zipcode": "10001"
    },
    "hobbies": ["reading", "hiking", "cooking"]
    }

You can project specific nested fields or array elements:

    // Include only the "name" and "address.city" fields
    db.users.find({}, { name: 1, "address.city": 1 });

    // Exclude all hobbies except "hiking"
    db.users.find({}, { "hobbies": { $elemMatch: { $eq: "hiking" } } });

Using Projection with Update Operations:

Projection can also be used with update operations like updateOne() and updateMany() to specify which fields should be updated. For example:

    // Update the "age" field and exclude all other fields
    db.users.updateOne({ name: "John" }, { $set: { age: 35 } }, { projection: { age: 1 } });

    In this example, only the "age" field is updated, and all other fields are excluded from the updated document.

Projection in MongoDB is a powerful feature that allows you to tailor your query results to your specific needs, whether you want to retrieve a subset of fields, protect sensitive information, or optimize query performance.

---

6. instanceof

---

The instanceof operator in JavaScript is used to check if an object is an instance of a particular class or constructor function. It allows you to determine if an object inherits from a specific class or prototype.

    Syntax: object instanceof constructor

    object: The object you want to check.
    constructor: The constructor function or class to check against.

The instanceof operator returns true if the object is an instance of the specified constructor; otherwise, it returns false.

Here's an example of how to use instanceof:

    class Animal {
        constructor(name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
    }

    class Dog extends Animal {
        constructor(name, breed) {
            super(name);
            this.breed = breed;
        }
    }

    const myDog = new Dog("Fido", "Golden Retriever");

    console.log(myDog instanceof Dog);    // true
    console.log(myDog instanceof Animal); // true
    console.log(myDog instanceof Object); // true
    console.log(myDog instanceof Cat);    // false

---

7. fs.access()

---

fs.access() is a method provided by the Node.js built-in fs (File System) module. It is used to check if a file or directory exists and if your program has permission to access it. It helps you avoid errors when working with files or directories.

    Syntax:
    const fs = require('fs');

    fs.access(path, mode, (err) => {
    if (err) {
        // Handle the error (file does not exist or permission denied)
    } else {
        // The file or directory at the specified path exists and is accessible
    }
    });

    The fs.access() method takes two arguments:

    1. path: This is the path to the file or directory you want to check.

    2.The callback function is called with an error if the accessibility check fails (e.g., the file doesn't exist or the permissions are insufficient), or it is called without an error if the check is successful.

    mode: This is an optional parameter that specifies the type of accessibility check to perform. It can be one of the following constants:
    fs.constants.F_OK: Checks if the file exists.
    fs.constants.R_OK: Checks if the file is readable.
    fs.constants.W_OK: Checks if the file is writable.
    fs.constants.X_OK: Checks if the file is executable.

Here's an example of how you can use fs.access() to check if a file exists:

    const fs = require('fs');

    const filePath = '/path/to/your/file.txt';

    fs.access(filePath, fs.constants.F_OK, (err) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error(`${filePath} does not exist.`);
    } else {
        console.log(`${filePath} exists.`);
    }
    });

Keep in mind that fs.access() only checks for the existence and permissions of a file or directory at the time of the function call. It doesn't guarantee that the file will remain accessible in the future, as file system conditions can change.

---

8. fs.unlink()

---

fs.unlink() is a method provided by the Node.js built-in fs (File System) module. It is used to asynchronously delete (unlink) a file from the local file system. This method takes two arguments:

    1. The path to the file you want to delete.
    2. A callback function that will be called once the file has been successfully deleted or if an error occurs during the deletion process.

Here's an example of how you might use fs.unlink() to delete a file:

    const fs = require('fs');

    const filePath = '/path/to/your/file.txt';

    fs.unlink(filePath, (err) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error(`Error deleting file: ${err}`);
    } else {
        console.log(`File has been successfully deleted: ${filePath}`);
    }
    });

It's important to be cautious when using fs.unlink() because it permanently deletes files, and there is no way to recover them once they are deleted. Therefore, it's a good practice to check if the file exists using fs.access() or fs.existsSync() before attempting to delete it to avoid accidental data loss.

---

9. Model.modelName

---

Model.modelName is a property provided by Mongoose that returns the name of the Mongoose model associated with a specific schema. It's essentially a way to programmatically get the name of the model.

    For example:

    const mongoose = require('mongoose');

    // Define a schema
    const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    email: String,
    });

    // Compile the schema into a model
    // Model Syntaz: const Model = mongoose.model('ModelName', schema);
    const UserModel = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

In this example, 'UserModel' is a Mongoose model. Therefore, 'UserModel' is the instance of 'Model' , and 'modelName' is a property of the Mongoose model ('UserModel') which holds the string 'User' as its value.

Model.modelName is a property of the Mongoose model. When you define a model using mongoose.model('User', userSchema), the model name is set to "User" by convention. So, Model.modelName will return the string "User" in this case.

---

10. Model.exists()

---

In Mongoose, the Model.exists() method is used to check if at least one document matching a specified condition exists in a MongoDB collection. This method is asynchronous and returns a promise.

    Here's the syntax for Model.exists():
    Model.exists(conditions, callback);

    Model: The Mongoose model representing the MongoDB collection you want to check for the existence of documents.
    conditions: An object specifying the conditions to search for within the collection.
    callback (optional): A callback function that will be executed once the existence check is complete. This callback follows the standard Node.js error-first callback pattern and receives two arguments: error (if an error occurs) and result (a boolean indicating whether documents matching the conditions exist).

Here's an example of how to use Model.exists():

    // Check if a user with the name 'John' exists
    User.exists({ name: 'John' }, (err, result) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error(`Error checking existence: ${err}`);
    } else {
        if (result) {
        console.log('User with the name "John" exists.');
        } else {
        console.log('User with the name "John" does not exist.');
        }
    }

    });

---

11. .replace()

---

The .replace() method in JavaScript allows you to find a specific part in a text and change it to something else.

    string.replace(searchValue, replacementValue)

    string: The original string on which you want to perform the replacement.
    searchValue: The substring or regular expression pattern to search for within the original string.
    replacementValue: The substring or function to replace the matched occurrences with.

Here are some examples how .replace() works:

    Example 1: Replace a Substring

        const originalString = "Hello, World!";
        const replacedString = originalString.replace("World", "Universe");
        console.log(replacedString); // Output: "Hello, Universe!"

    Example 2: Replace All Occurrences with a Regular Expression

        const originalString = "Apples are red, bananas are yellow, and apples are tasty.";
        const replacedString = originalString.replace(/apples/gi, "oranges");
        console.log(replacedString);
        // Output: "Oranges are red, bananas are yellow, and oranges are tasty."

    Example 3: Using a Function for Replacement
        const originalString = "The year is 2022, and 2022 is the current year.";
        const replacedString = originalString.replace(/\d{4}/g, (match) => {
        return String(Number(match) + 1);
        });
        console.log(replacedString);
        // Output: "The year is 2023, and 2023 is the current year."

Remember that the .replace() method does not modify the original string; it returns a new string with the replacements. If you want to modify the original string, you need to assign the result back to the original variable.

---

12. substring()

---

In JavaScript, the substring() method is used to extract a portion of a string, creating a new string. It takes two parameters:

Here's the basic syntax of the substring() method:

    string.substring(start, end);

        start: is the position (index) where you want to start extracting characters.

        end (optional): is the position (index) where you want to stop extracting characters. If you don't provide it, the extraction goes up to the end of the string.

Here are some examples:

    const text = "Hello, world!";
    const sub1 = text.substring(0, 5); // Returns "Hello"
    const sub2 = text.substring(7, 12); // Returns "world"
    const sub3 = text.substring(7); // Returns "world!"
    const sub4 = text.substring(-6, -1); // Returns "world"

    console.log(sub1);
    console.log(sub2);
    console.log(sub3);
    console.log(sub4);

---

13. include()

---

In JavaScript, the includes() method is used to check whether a string, array, or another iterable object contains a specific value. It returns true if the value is found within the object, and false if it is not found. Here's how you can use it:
Syntax:

For Strings:
string.includes(searchString[, position])

    const str = "Hello, world!";
    const check1 = str.includes("Hello"); // true
    const check2 = str.includes("foo"); // false

    console.log(check1);
    console.log(check2);

For Arrays:
array.includes(searchElement[, fromIndex])

    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const check1 = numbers.includes(3); // true
    const check2 = numbers.includes(6); // false

    console.log(check1);
    console.log(check2);

For Iterables:
You can also use includes() with other iterable objects, like arrays:

    const iterable = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const check1 = iterable.includes(3); // true
    const check2 = iterable.includes(6); // false

    console.log(check1);
    console.log(check2);

---

14. .array()

---

In Express.js and express-validator, .array() is a method used to retrieve an array of validation errors. It is typically used after running validation checks on request data. When you call .array(), it collects all the validation errors that occurred during the validation process and returns them as an array.

Here's how you can use .array() with express-validator:

    const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();

    app.use(express.json());

    app.post('/user', [
    body('username').notEmpty().withMessage('Username is required'),
    body('email').isEmail().withMessage('Email is not valid'),
    ], (req, res) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);

    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
        const errorArray = errors.array();
        res.status(400).json({ errors: errorArray });
    } else {
        // Continue with the route logic if there are no validation errors
        res.status(200).json({ message: 'User created successfully' });
    }
    });

    app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
    });

---

15. express-validator: validation chains and methods

---

express-validator is a popular middleware library for Express.js that provides a wide range of validation chains and methods to validate incoming request data. Here are some of the most commonly used validation chains and their uses:

    body(): Thsi is a specific validation chain that is often used for validating request body data. It is commonly used in combination with the express.urlencoded or express.json middleware to validate request body parameters.
    You use body to specify the field within the request body that you want to validate.

        const { body } = require('express-validator');

        app.post('/signup', [
        body('username').notEmpty(),
        body('email').isEmail(),
        // ...
        ], (req, res) => {
        // Handle the validation results
        });

    .notEmpty(): Checks if a field is not empty or undefined.

    .exists(): exists is especially useful when you want to ensure the presence of certain fields in the request before applying other validation rules. It doesn't check the value of the field, only its existence.

    .isEmail(): Validates if a field is a valid email address.

    .isLength(): Checks the length of a field, allowing you to specify minimum and maximum lengths.
        body('password').isLength({ min: 6, max: 20 });

    .trim(): Removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.
        body('username').trim();

    .matches(): Validates a field against a regular expression.
        body('username').matches(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/, 'i');

    .withMessage(): Allows you to customize error messages for specific validation chains.
        body('email').isEmail().withMessage('Invalid email address');
        body('username').notEmpty().withMessage((value, { req }) => `Username cannot be empty for ${req.body.email}`)

    .isNumeric(): Checks if a field contains only numeric characters.

    .isAlpha(): Checks if a field contains only alphabetic characters.

    .isAlphanumeric(): Validates if a field contains only alphanumeric characters.

    .isInt(): Checks if a field is an integer.

    .isFloat(): Checks if a field is a floating-point number.

    .isBoolean(): Validates if a field is a boolean value.

    .isDate(): Checks if a field is a valid date.

    .isIn(): Checks if a field's value is one of a specified array of values.
        body('gender').isIn(['male', 'female', 'other']);

    .isURL(): Validates if a field is a valid URL.

    .isPostalCode(): Validates that a field is a valid postal code.
        body('zipcode').isPostalCode('US'); // Validate U.S. ZIP codes

    .equals(): Compares a field's value to a specified value.

    .custom(): Allows you to define custom validation logic for a field.
        body('age').custom((value) => {
        if (value < 18) {
            throw new Error('Age must be at least 18');
        }
        return true;
        });

    .customSanitizer(): Allows you to define custom sanitization logic.
        body('phone').customSanitizer(value => {
        // Remove non-numeric characters from a phone number
        return value.replace(/\D/g, '');
        });

    .normalizeEmail(): Normalizes an email address by converting it to lowercase and removing extra spaces.
        body('email').normalizeEmail();



    .optional(): Marks a validation chain as optional, so it won't trigger an error if the field is missing.
        body('optionalField').optional().isEmail();

    .isArray(): Checks if a field is an array.

    .isArray({ min: 2, max: 5 }): Validates that an array field contains a minimum of 2 elements and a maximum of 5 elements.

    .isMongoId():Validates that a field is a valid MongoDB ObjectId.
        body('userId').isMongoId();

    .isUUID(): Checks if a field is a valid UUID (Universally Unique Identifier).
        body('itemId').isUUID(4); // Version 4 UUID

    .equals(): Compares the field's value with a given value.
        body('passwordConfirmation').equals(req.body.password);

    .isCurrency(): Validates that a field contains a valid currency amount.
        body('price').isCurrency();

    .isISBN(): Validates that a field contains a valid ISBN (International Standard Book Number).
        body('isbn').isISBN(13); // ISBN-13

    .isJSON(): Checks if a field contains valid JSON data.
        body('jsonData').isJSON();

    .isMimeType(): Validates that a field's value matches a valid MIME type.
        body('avatar').isMimeType();

    .isMACAddress(): Checks if a field contains a valid MAC address.
        body('macAddress').isMACAddress();

    .isSlug():: Validates that a field contains a valid URL slug.
        body('slug').isSlug();

    .isPostalCode(): Validates that a field contains a valid postal code for a specified country.
        body('zipcode').isPostalCode('US'); // Validate U.S. ZIP codes

    .isIP(): Checks if a field contains a valid IP address (IPv4 or IPv6).
        body('ipAddress').isIP();

16. for...in Loop:

---

Purpose: Used for iterating over the enumerable properties of an object, typically the object's own properties (not inherited properties).
Works with: Objects (enumerating keys/properties).
Iterates over: Property names (keys).
Example:

    const person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 30,
    };

    for (const key in person) {
    console.log(key, person[key]);
    }
    Output:
        firstName John
        lastName Doe
        age 30

---

17. for...of Loop:

---

Purpose: Used for iterating over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, sets, and more. It iterates over the values of these objects.
Works with: Iterable data structures (e.g., arrays, strings).
Iterates over: Values.
Example:

    const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

    for (const color of colors) {
    console.log(color);
    }
    Output:
        red
        green
        blue

18. startsWith

---

startsWith is a JavaScript string method that is used to determine whether a string begins with the characters of a specified string. It checks if the given string starts with a particular substring and returns true if the string starts with that substring, or false otherwise.

Here's the syntax

    string.startsWith(searchString[, position])
    Example :

        const str = 'Hello, world!';

        // Check if str starts with 'Hello'
        const startsWithHello = str.startsWith('Hello');
        console.log(startsWithHello); // true

        // Check if str starts with 'world'
        const startsWithWorld = str.startsWith('world');
        console.log(startsWithWorld); // false
